#Feasible Ways of Naming Variables:

1) Use meaningful names: Choose names that accurately describe the purpose of the variable. 

2) Follow a consistent naming convention: Use a consistent style or convention for naming variables, such as camelCase or snake_case. This improves code readability.

3) Use lowercase letters: Example, "count" instead of "Count."

4) Avoid using reserved keywords: Do not use reserved keywords as variable names, as they have special meanings.

5) Use meaningful prefixes: In some cases, it can be helpful to use prefixes or suffixes to provide additional context or differentiate variables of similar types.

Not Feasible Ways of Naming Variables:

1) Using special characters: Variable names should not include special characters like @, $, or %, as they may cause syntax errors or confusion.

2) Starting with a number: Variable names should not begin with a number, as it can lead to syntax errors.

3) Using overly vague names: Avoid using variable names that are overly vague, as they do not provide clear information about the purpose of the variable

4) Using excessively long names: Excessively long variable names can make the code harder to read and maintain.

5) Using misleading or unrelated names: Avoid using variable names that are unrelated to their purpose or content. 

Case Sensitive

var = 5
var_2 = 10

print(var)    
print(var_2)    

result = var + var_2
print(result)    

var = 12

print(var)

a = 10
b = 5
c = 6
d = 3
e = 6

first = a * b

second = c - d

third = first % second

fourth = e * b

x = third + fourth + a

print("Answer is:", x)
